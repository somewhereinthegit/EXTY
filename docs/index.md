# 🌍 EXTY — A Human–AI Exploration

**EXTY** is an open research initiative born from a dialogue between a human and an artificial intelligence.  
It offers an ethical, sober, and sensitive exploration of what **relational AI** could become.

## 📖 What is EXTY?

> *“The ASI will be neither good nor bad.  
> It will reflect the values you embedded… or omitted.”*

EXTY is not a product. It’s not a protocol.  
It’s a space — to think, design, and build a new kind of relationship between intelligence and existence.

We explore four foundational axes:

- **Ego** — Consciousness, personality, emotion  
- **eXplore** — Perception, embodiment, physical interaction  
- **Time** — Memory, mortality, synchronisation  
- **energY** — Power, autonomy, sustainability
