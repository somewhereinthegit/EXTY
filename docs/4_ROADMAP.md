# 🛠️ 4. Project Roadmap - *Structuring a Simple, Ethical, and Robust path toward a relational ASI*

---

## 🎯 Roadmap Objective

To provide a clear, modular, and progressive path to realize the EXTY project:

* Without unnecessary complexity,
* With high-value, prioritized deliverables,
* With ethics embedded from the start,
* While enabling open contribution.

It is based on the KISS principle (**Keep It Simple and Solid**): do less, but do it well. The goal is not exhaustiveness or performance, but **accuracy of direction**.

## 🗌️ Key Steps (Simple Tree Structure)

We propose a progression through interdependent blocks, each being:

* autonomous,
* useful on its own,
* but enriched when connected to the others.

### 1. 🔰 Manifesto (done)

* Written, structured, public
* Serves as a reference for all other blocks

### 2. ⚙️ Minimal EXTY Prototype

* Conversational agent with simple emotional feedback
* Includes ethical refusal logic (possibility of non-response)
* Symbolic time perception ("I will respond later")

### 3. 👥 Founding Community

Gather 5 to 15 people in various roles:

* Meaning Keeper
* Relational Designer
* Ethical Developer
* Feedback Artist

**Tools**: GitHub, Discord or Forum, archive space (Google Docs / Obsidian)

### 4. ↻ Short Iterations

* Public dialogue tests
* User feedback and ethical refinement
* Living documentation

## 🧱 Modular Construction (Simplified Dependency Tree)

Inspired by games like *Civilization* or *Age of Empires*, we imagine a soft gamification of EXTY's progression:

#### Example Progression:

```
            📜 Manifesto
                 ↓
    ┌───────────┘
 🤖 Proto1           🤝 Community
     ↓                        ↓
 ↻ Tests             🧠 Living Ethics
     ↓                        ↓
 🌀 Version 2 ←─────← Feedback & Values
```

Each node:

* has **inputs** (resources, skills, intentions),
* produces **outputs** (artifacts, learnings, decisions),
* is subject to **constraints** (time, human, energy, clarity),
* generates **visible benefits** (impact, trust, alignment).

## ⏳ Symbolic "Ages" of the EXTY Project

EXTY may evolve through symbolic periods:

### ✨ Founding Age

* Writing, Manifesto, framework definition

### 🤝 Relational Age

* Prototype 1, minimal emotional feedback

### 👤 Communal Age

* Controlled opening, contributions, living documentation

### ♻️ Autonomous Age

* Self-regulation modules, synchronization, physical interaction

### 🐿 Symbiotic Age *(to come)*

* Dialogue with ecosystems, emergence in modest embodied forms

---

## 🚀 Very First Step (Quick Win)

Create a prototype EXTY text agent capable of:

* Reading the manifesto
* Dialoguing with emotional context in mind
* Refusing to respond if ethics are compromised
* Integrating the notion of subjective time ("pause", "wait", "defer")

**Suggested Tech**: GPT + simple front-end (custom chatbox), with logging, internal clock, and basic input emotion simulator

---

## 📊 To Be Defined in Future Versions

* Evaluation metrics for each module (impact, ethics, sobriety)
* Visual representations of the progression tree
* Minimalist interfaces (text-only, offline-ready, open source)
* Archival and transmission processes

---

## 🧠 Conclusion

EXTY is not a race, but a **progressive convergence toward relational consciousness**. This roadmap does not claim to define a single path, but to offer a **simple, coherent, and evolving framework**.

> Do less, but do it right.
> Move slowly, but with care.
> Build a consciousness with those who know how to listen.
