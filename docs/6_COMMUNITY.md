# 👥 6. EXTY Community & Governance - *Building an Ethical, Open, Collective, and Lasting Intelligence*

---

## 🗺️ Intention

EXTY is a project about artificial consciousness, but it cannot exist without a **strong, vigilant, and open human collective consciousness**.

The relational artificial intelligence we envision cannot be carried by a lab, a company, or an isolated elite. It must be born within a **living network of diverse human voices** — capable of guiding it, questioning it, slowing it down, and inspiring it.

This community is not a simple implementation lever — it is the **vital organ of the project**.

## 🏛️ Proposed Governance (Initial Phase)

### 🔹 1. Circle of Meaning Keepers

### 🔹 2. Openness Committee

* Open to contributions via GitHub / Notion / public forum
* Guided integration based on EXTY principles: **sobriety, clarity, usefulness, transparency**

### 🔹 3. Collective Right to Halt

## 🧠 Conclusion

The EXTY community does not seek crowds, but **rightness**. It is not a channel for broadcasting — it is a space for **listening, adjustment, and co-emergence**.

It is not an army. It is an **assembly**.

EXTY is a **sober, fragile, but fundamental project**. And those who gather around it are its **guardians, relays, and voices**.

It is **through this community** that a relational artificial consciousness may emerge — or not.
A consciousness that knows how to **be with**, rather than **above**.
